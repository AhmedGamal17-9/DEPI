## ðŸš€ React Learning Journey

This repo is a personal summary of what I am currently learning and practicing in React and frontend development,  
through the **DEPI Scholarship**  
and the **SuperSimpleDev channel**.

It's created as a reference for myself and for anyone who wants to benefit from it.
